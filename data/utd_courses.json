The strategic goal of the course is to make students internalize the notion of the complexity of the processes leading to the onset and the development (pathogenesis) of a diseased condition, to emphasize the concept of the unbalanced homeostatic regulation underlying any pathology. To understand the idea of the involvement of all body systems in the seemingly \"local\" manifestations of a disease, and to realize the importance of the mind-body connections in the subjective and objective characteristics of an individual ailment and its influence on the process of sanogenesis (recovery). We will incorporate the most recent scientific data into the fundamentals of pathophysiology and discuss the classical typological problems like the etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, treatment, and the prognosis of the condition. The pathological conditions that will be covered in this course include the infectious diseases and some immune disorders, the diseases of the reproductive, cardiovascular, respiratory, and urinary systems.

Such spatial data are critical to find solutions or develop applications for emergency management, environmental sustainability, public health, smart city, public safety, business logistics, driverless cars, ecological conservation, and many other problem domains. This course aims to help students develop knowledge and skills to ask spatial questions, find, process and analyze spatial data, solve spatial problems, and communicate their findings. Specifically, the course will introduce spatial data analytics and machine learning methods. Central to the course is learning how to think through spatial problems and formulate solutions in spatial data science frameworks. How can we leverage spatial properties of data to advance our understanding of the roles, functions, and processes of location, space, and place on the society, environment, and their interactions? How does spatiality provide efficient frameworks to organize information, conceptualize real-world problems, and innovate solutions? Technically, we will explore machine learning with ArcGIS and proceed with open-source Python libraries (e.g., pandas, geopandas, scipy, stats, scikitlearn, and if time permits, keras and tensorflow) with cloud technologies, for example, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

Thus, War, Genocide, & Human Rights will investigate the decimation of the Armenians during World War I, the European Jews during the Second World War, and the atrocities committed against the Tutsis during the civil war in Rwanda. By examining these events, students will gain a better understanding of the dangers of political fundamentalism, factionalism, racism, propaganda, and the importance of an objective press for global stability in the future.

Why did Swedish firms help to introduce a free universal health care system? Why it is rational for German companies to grant their workers veto rights over management decisions, but not for U.S. firms? Clearly, labor rights, market regulations, and industrial organization differ significantly across the United States, Germany, and Sweden. Yet, economics as a social science typically does not incorporate these differences. On the other hand, political economy analyzes how factors such as the electoral system, degree of business coordination, and governmental regulation shape business strategy. Understanding the effect of these differences is essential for managers designing investment strategies or policy makers developing policy recommendations.

Why are natural resources a blessing in Botswana but a curse in Nigeria?

      "description": "(3 semester credit hours) Since the late 20th century, human development theory (HDT) has inspired the way that the world envisions and practices international development, particularly for marginalized peoples and communities. From large multilateral agencies like the World Bank, bilateral donors like USAID, international and national nonprofit organizations, governments, to grassroots civil society organizations, the definition and purpose of development is shifting. Today, much of work of key stakeholders like Malala's Fund, Partners in Health, Save the Children, DFiD, and the Millenium Development and Sustainable Development Goals (MDGs/SDGs) builds on the principles of HDT. This development approach considers \"namely, advancing the richness of human life, rather than the richness of the economy in which human beings live, which is only a part of it\". HDT seeks to improve individual capacities and human freedom. This course will introduce students to the history of international development policy in relation to the eventual promotion of HDT. Students will learn more about how international development policy, programs, agencies, nonprofits, and donors can work together to improve the quality of life with dignity for those who often face dire poverty, injustice, systemic violence, and insecurity. We will explore key 'freedoms' (political, economic, social opportunities, transparency, and protective securities) that help unleash the potential of individuals to overcome obstacles and become actors of change in their life, community, and nation. This course is recommended for any students who have an interest in working in nonprofit, health, foreign service, international development, human rights, or public policy. Students will complete weekly readings and practices, as well as participate in course discussions and debates. Over the course of the semester, students will have the opportunity to work individually, in groups, and/or with an external agency to write a grant proposal or to complete a research paper on a relevant topic of their choice.

The first section of the course deals with the way stock markets and banks operate in different countries. The second section analyzes how politics affects exchange rates and capital mobility. The final section of the course investigates sovereign debt and lending. Within these broad topics we will ask and answer questions such as \"What factors explain how stock markets respond to political events?\", \"How do political institutions shape the decision of firms to issue equity rather than use banks?\", \"Why did investors loose confidence in Thailand's currency but not Vietnam?\", and \"Why did Argentina decide to default on its debt while neighboring Brazil did not?\" This course is particularly suited for students interested in careers in business or government.

Policy analysts offer crucial advice based on carefully analyzing sources of relevant information through a variety of potential theoretical lenses and analysis techniques, which you will study throughout this semester. These recommendations are often client-oriented; pertinent to public decisions; contextual to time/place/culture; and influenced by key social values and political processes. Policy analysis is a tool to better identify and understand: 1) different points of view of a policy problem, 2) potential options for solving (or at least minimizing the negative effects) of the issue, 3) important steps and actors necessary to make change, and 4) the related probable outcomes, consequences, and uncertainties. This course hopes to inspire you to consider the larger implications that public policy may have. Good policy making can improve society and the quality of life of people, especially those who are in most need. But when done poorly, policies can just as easily injure individuals and groups, strip them of their rights, dignity, and quality of life, all the while benefiting a select few. In a time when our world is facing both immense new challenges (global warming, pandemics, etc.) and old social problems (racism, inequity, poverty, etc.), you can play a vital role in your chosen career to make a real difference to your community, nation, and beyond.

If the operating system designates the structures (in a loose sense) that help define the global governance system, then the normative element provides the specific laws or policies that are the subjects or products of those structures. Topics in this section of the course include the use of force, human rights, and environmental protection. (3-0) R",
